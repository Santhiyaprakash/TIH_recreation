# TIH_recreation
This repository contains the React-based version of our Technology Innovation Hub website. The site showcases our innovative projects, latest technologies, and collaborative initiatives. It was originally built using HTML and CSS, and has now been fully reimagined with React for enhanced interactivity, modularity, and performance.
